Game: Asteroids2
Inspired by:
a. Developed in Javascript and HTML5
b. Asteroids (arcade game: Lyle Rains & Ed Logg, released by Atari Inc, 1979)
   Immortal "Asteroids" game: One of my biggest and favorite games from the 80's.

Keys:

F5: re-start
W: hacia adelante
A: rotacion hacia la izquierda
D: rotacion hacia la derecha
Tab: disparo


Initially, our instructor Sam suggested that I evaluate this video tutorial.

"Code Asteroids in JavaScript (1979 Atari game) - tutorial"

The following follows.
A complex but understandable code based on what is known in this JS course.
 
1. The code base is in vanilla JavaScript: in the development of functions (constructors)
callback functions and, the transformation of trigonometric mathematical equations to JS.
2. The reconstruction of the code shown in the video has led me to the development of 7 JS files, 1 HTML file
where the JS files are called, and a file with the sounds.
3. However, its development is still complex for our short exposure time to JS.
4. The code reconstructed and shown in Visual Studio code is functional and preliminarily shown in class to Mr. Sam.

5. PSEUDOCODE:
    Therefore the above has served as a basis and training to see the 'philosophy' and inspiration of a pseudocode
which I have also shown to Mr. Sam and, trying to extract the "best" of the previous code coupled with new research
of the mathematics involved in the video game physics (of friction, gravity, rotation, angles, collision, etc) and trigonometry (straight lines, sine, cosine, and their relationship with
the initial positioning in the center of canvas drawing).
6. The new game that I have simply called "Asteroids2", is now less complex, lighter, and contains the minimum elements for
the functionality of the game, trying to reflect more my own understanding of the process of creating a project
of which its components, mechanics and function and its complexity are mostly unknown.
Similar to what might be reflected in the real professional work environment.
